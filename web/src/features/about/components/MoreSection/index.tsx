        I enjoy reading as many books as I can. I am currently reading George
        R.R. Martin&apos;s Game of Thrones series (currently at the fourth book
        ðŸ˜„), Isaac Asimov&apos;s Foundation series (at the third book ðŸ˜®),
        J.R.R. Tolkien&apos;s Unfinished Tales, and Stephen King&apos;s It. My
        favorite book is Dune by Frank Herbert.

        I also enjoy watching films and television with Children of Men by
        Alfonso CuarÃ³n being my favorite movie of all time, and my favorite TV
        show is a tie between Breaking Bad and Attack on Titan.

        A few minor things about me is that I like to be active by going to the
        gym, running, or hiking with rock climbing as my next goal. I love
        videogames with Half-Life 2 being my all-time favorite. From
        time-to-time, I continue to learn physics and how to apply them
        computationally. Lastly, I enjoy helping others whether it is community
        service or teaching.
